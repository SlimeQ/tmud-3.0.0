      You are standing on the bottom of a wide crack in the matrix, going 
      north and south. The sides of the fault are alive with writhing 
      worm-like things, snaking out from the cracked glass, sparking madly.
      To your west, a pile of great slabs of glass has fallen into a jumble 
      beside the wall. They are much too large and sharp-edged for you to 
      lose your precious fingers on! To the south, there is at least four 
      yards between the furthest reaches of the worm-like strands, but to the 
      north, the crack narrows to a point where it is impossible to pass.

      You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
      small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
      towering over you, overwhelming you...
      The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
      starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
      To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
      hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

      You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
      The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
      appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
      picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.
         Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
      mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.

      carved into the mountain.
      You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
      from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
      a cave (or a grave :-).

      the wall, just above the altar which is set against the western wall.  A well
      in the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from
      the depths.

      You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
      your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
      over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
      some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
      A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
      good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
      others haven't breathed before you.
      To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

      glass has fallen into a jumble beside the wall. They are much too large 
      and sharp-edged for you to climb and lose your precious fingers on! To 
      the south, there is at least four yards between the furthest reaches of 
      the worm-like strands..

      there is a natural-looking tunnel leading east. The purple glow from 
      within the tunnel, however, is anything but natural-looking...

      You squeeze your way through a small, narrow tunnel. The sharp-edged rocks
      protruding from the walls threathen to scratch and cut you. 
      To the south you sense a freshness in the air which is rather unusual in these
      damp, stuffy tunnels. To the north the tunnel continues.

      Surrounding to all sides but north, a pile of great slabs of glass has 
      fallen into a jumble beside the wall. They are much too large and 
      sharp-edged for you to climb and lose your precious fingers on! To the 
      north, there is at least four yards between the furthest reaches of the 
      worm-like strands, but to the south, the crack narrows to a point where 
      it is impossible to pass.

      It ends in what seems like a large bedroom up there.

      You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
      light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
      the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
      on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
      To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
      shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
      north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
      looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
      this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

      hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the

      You are walking in a narrow tunnel. The walls are only roughly shaped,
      sharp rocks protruding everywhere, even from the floor making you stumble in
      the flickering light. To the south the tunnel narrows even more making it
      almost impossible to pass. To the north it slowly widens into a cave. There
      is a branch of the tunnel going west.

      rumpled bed and a table piled high with yestercycle's dirty dishes. 
      In the wall to the west, a tunnel leads out to the Matrix Fault.

      You are standing in the bar.  The bar is set against the northern wall, old
      archaic writing, carvings and symbols cover its top.  A fireplace is built into
      the western wall, and through the southeastern windows you can see the temple
      square.  This place makes you feel like home.
      A small sign with big letters is fastened to the bar.

      that door.

    :desc: |
      You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
      the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
      but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
      To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
      metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

    :name: The sunny field
    :desc: |
      You are standing in the middle of a wide, summery, sunlit field. There is a
      fragrance of spring in the air, a sound of summer and a feeling of eternal
      saturday afternoon. To the south is a clear, sparkling lake, and to the north
      and west is the holy grove. In the wood's edge, to the east, is a stately man-
      sion, shimmering softly through the colors of the rainbow. You feel as if You
      could spend the rest of your life here, lying on your back and looking at the
      patterns of the clouds as they gently drift across the sky.

      to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
      originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
      It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
                 ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
      The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

      looking pipes and flasks.  The floor is covered with half-erased pentagrams
      and even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark corner has only been
      partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly visible.  A well in
      the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the
      depths.

      walls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar
      shades, producing a very nice, cool effect. There is a large bed and a
      matching set of sofas, easy-chairs and a coffee table. Through the venetian
      blinds in front of the large east window you can see the edge of the grove.

      You are in a very strange sewer indeed, there are some odd scrates on the
      pipe wall, as from a gigantic rat. And you can see a lot of organic decay
      like bones from animals AND humans. West the drain runs slightly upwards.

    :name: The damp sewer
    :desc: |
      You are in a sewer drain with a funny damp substance on the floor, in the 
      substance you see a lot of decay. You see some odd scrates on the wall, as
      from a gigantic rat. Both to the east and west the pipe seems to run down.

    :desc: |
      You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
      belief, He *Doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
      variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
      tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
      along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
      stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
      than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         There is a strong smell of ozone here, probably caused by a
      circle of pale blue lightening, app. 2 yards diameter, which is 
      hanging in the air 1 yd off the ground, revolving slowly around 
      its vertical axis.

    :desc: |
      This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
      plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
      though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
      the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
      see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
      coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
      terrace.

      of his adventures.  An iron door is set in the east wall of the hall.  On the
      door is a golden plate with some writing on it.

      numerous shelves crammed with jars, bottles, books and scrolls of all
      sorts and sizes.

      You are standing in a lot of mud. A disguisting smell surrounds
      the place, and makes you fell sick. Small flames sometimes shoot
      up from the hot mud. To the west there is a small door. To the 
      north you can see an iron door.

      An acrid smell fills this large room.  Along the walls are numerous
      shelves containing all sorts of animal hide and in the crackling fireplace
      hangs a big iron pot with boiling water.  In the middle of the room is a
      large oak table.
      A wooden sign is hanging above the fireplace.

      wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you barrs its way. However you
      are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
      The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
      anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
      enter the hills far away north.

      You can't see anything but the ground where you put your feet. The
      passageway seems to continue west and north. To the east there's water
      covering the floor and that leads through an arched entry to a watery
      sewer.

      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         There is a tall beacon pole standing here, on top of which a 
      powerful light strobes dizzyingly through the spectrum.

      barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.  To the east, you can
      see the stately oaks and poplars of the holy grove

      a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.

      Wide slabs of broken, dull glass with sharp edges provide a way
      down amidst the debris. It is uncertain, however, whether they 
      will provide a way up...

      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To the south, you can see the northern end of a wide fault in
      the glassy material, that covers the ground.

      down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness, 
      mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
      washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops, 
      like a waterfall, into the pool far down.

      You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
      down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness,
      mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
      washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops,
      like a waterfall, into the pool far down. Under you there is a small fissure
      in the rock. It seems big enough to contain a few people.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To your west, a wide chasm opens in the glassy material, that
      cover the ground. A wooden log has been placed across it here.
         High above you, a vaguely-seen glass road stretches from 
      north to south.

      This place gives you the creeps.

      Nice place you found yourself. You stand in the middle of a room with only
      two exits, Up and East. A tall ladder is left here so that you can climb
      up through the Pit without the use of a rope.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To the east, a narrow, but steep, crack opens in the ground.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To your west, a wide chasm opens in the glassy material, that
      cover the ground.
         Above you, southwest of you, towers a gigantic structure; a pale 
      blue pyramid, several hundred meters tall, standing inverted tip-to-
      tip on a smaller (some 10-20 meters tall) pyramid.
         High above you, a vaguely-seen glass road stretches south, from
      a barely-seen opening in the upper pyramid.

      You stand, swaying out from the ledge, with only a couple of inches of safe, 
      solid ledge under your feet. The ledge continues to the east but not back
      south. It seems that the ledge is too narrow to turn on so you'll have to
      continue foreward.

      You are in the progress of walking all the way around the ledge since there's
      no way of turning around on this all too narrow path. There IS another exit
      from here but that leads right into mid-air and with high probability of a
      free fall session afterwards.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To the north, you can see the southern end of a wide fault in
      the glassy material that covers the ground.

      You are at the Concourse.  The city wall is just east and a small
      promenade goes west.  Looking across the river you see a building that
      resembles a warehouse.  The Concourse continues south along the city wall.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         Above you, to the north-east, towers a gigantic structure; a 
      pale blue pyramid, several hundred meters tall, standing in-
      verted tip-to-tip on a smaller (some 10-20 meters tall) pyramid.
         High above you, a glass road only faintly seen sweeps to the
      northeast and the south.

      You are standing in dust. This place has not been
      touched for a long time. Otherwise it is quite boring
      here, looks like a place to rest! To the west you see
      the outline of a door. A tunnel leads to the east.

      With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you
      are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to
      be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.

      The muddy sewer stretches into the dark to the south. It looks as if 
      no person has ever sat his foot here before. It's too muddy for that
      anyway. The sewer leads north, south and east from here.

      You are standing on a ledge that seems quite a lot larger than the rest 
      of the ledges. This one leads to the west and the east, plus it has an exit
      going to the south. Though you could jump into mid-air, but it probably 
      wouldn't be such a good idea. The way south is in utter darkness.

      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To the east, some crystalline structures, looking like glass
      trees, bars your way.

      You wouldn't want to know the true feeling of standing in this mud up to 
      your hips. >BWAADR<. All that fills your mind right now is the dream of 
      a hot bath. This is NOT very clean mud you know, remember you're in the
      sewer! The pipes leads north, south and east.

      You are standing in a long corridor, curving north and west. There 
      is a noticeable layer of fine dust covering everything here. The 
      grey-painted walls are flaking, revealing more of the glass-like 
      material that also covers the ground above. There is a wide crack in 
      the ceiling above, but it is too high for you to reach.
